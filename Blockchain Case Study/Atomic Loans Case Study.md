# Case Study: Atomic Loans

## Overview and Origin

Atomic Loans is a Toronto based Fin Tech firm that was founded in 2019. "It is a protocol for bitcoin and crypto-backed loans on the users' terms, without middlemen. By extending atomic swap technology, Atomic Loans enables users to interact with trustless, cross-chain debt agreements. We use the functionality of the native Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains to enable lending without requiring customers to delegate trust to centralized custodians, ensuring their funds will never be stolen or seized." It aims to bring decentralized finance to the bitcoin market.

Atomic Loans is building the first bitcoin native solution for decentralized finance. Its protocol and user-facing platform enables a marketplace for bitcoin backed lending. 

## Business Activities

Atomic Loans' platform works by allowing a two-sided marketplace for bitcoin backed lending. It allows users to lock their bitcoin in a non-custodial escrow and borrow an Ethereum stablecoin such as DAI or USDC. Users can then now leverage bitcoin to trade or pay for expenses without creating a taxable event or losing exposure to bitcoin price upside. The process of taking out a bitcoin-backed loan requires just one on-chain bitcoin transaction to lock collateral, and one Ethereum transaction to withdraw the loan.

## Landscape

Atomic Loans brings a business model which is completely unique and ground breaking. Atomic Loans aims to bring decentralized finance to the bitcoin market. Decentralized finance in the crypto space refers to financial applications that are being developed on top of blockchain systems.

"Although cryptocurrencies are built on decentralized technology, lending platforms and exchanges can either be centralized or decentralized in how they operate. Centralized exchanges represent blockchain-based assets within an internal database that only the exchange can control. One example of a type of centralized exchange is QuadrigaCX, which lost access to $250 million in cryptocurrency last year after its CEO, the only person who had access to the exchange’s cold wallets, passed away. Popular centralized exchanges include Coinbase and Kraken.

Ethereum, which is a cryptocurrency and ledger technology, has allowed for more decentralized applications. Due to the fact that bitcoin is just a cryptocurrency, not a ledger technology, it has been relatively untapped by decentralized finance.

Atomic Loans’ decentralized platform allows borrowers and lenders to engage in peer-to-peer bitcoin-backed loans, without the need for centralized custodians."

## Results

Atomic Loans is venturing into untested yet potentially lucrative territory. The need for decentralized peer to peer lending by utlizing financial applications developed on top of blockchain systems is a market which is virtually untapped. By engaging in the field, Atomic Loans seeks to tap into bitcoin which little or no DeFi works natively on. 

## Recommendations

DeFi is a growing field with so many variables yet untested and untapped. By utlizing bitcoin, Atomic Loans will become a pioneer in the industry. At the moment, it has $3.6 million Canadian in capitalization. My only recommendation is to not overextend beyond this amount when guaranteeing loans.
